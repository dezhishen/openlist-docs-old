![google-01-01-d](/img/drivers/google/google-01-01-d.png#dark)  

Otherwise, check ☑️ to use the API provided by OpenList. **⚠️ If using a Community server/self-hosted server, the built-in client ID and application secret of the Community server/self-hosted server are used at this time**.  

![google-01-02-l](/img/drivers/google/google-01-02-l.png#light)
![google-01-02-d](/img/drivers/google/google-01-02-d.png#dark)

6. Please pay attention to the permission information on the authorization page (in the red box below), ensure that it only accesses your **Google Drive files**. If you find that the permission in the Community service is not limited to accessing **Google Drive**, please raise an issue in [openlistteam/docs/issues](https://github.com/openlistteam/docs/issues).
